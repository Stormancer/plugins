Game sessions
=============

Enables game sessions in the application. The plugin supports:

- P2P and Client/Server game sessions
- Electing an host in P2P game sessions
- Managing game servers (requires adding ServerPools.hpp to the game server)
- Game session startup/shutdown events
- Game session results aggregation and processing in P2P (allows comparing game results from all peers) and Client/server (only the server sends game results)
- Public or access restricted game sessions.
