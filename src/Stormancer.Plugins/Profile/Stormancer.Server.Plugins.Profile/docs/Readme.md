# Profiles

This plugin provides a framework for user profiles, based on composition of profile parts generated by other plugins. When querying user profiles, the caller is expected to provide display options that filter the parts returned. For instance, include `["user"]="summary"` in the display options map to include simple data about the users, including the platform they last connected with and the pseudonym to display.

The plugin provides both Server side and client side profile access features. 

The Platform plugins integrate with the profiles plugin to provide platform pseudo by default.
